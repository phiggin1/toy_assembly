Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. 
Example:
"""
{"environment": 
    {
        'objects': ['tan tray', 'orange tray', 'tan horse body', 'blue horse legs', 'orange horse legs', 'table'], 
        'object_states': 
        {
            'tan tray': 'on_something(table)', 
            'orange tray': 'on_something(table)', 
            'tan horse body': 'on_something(orange tray)', 
            'blue horse legs': 'on_something(tan tray)', 
            'orange horse legs': 'on_something(tan tray)'
        }
    }
}
"""
Asset states and object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- attached_to(<something>): Object is attached to <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
"""
<something> should be one of the assets or objects in the environment.
An object cannot be on_something(<something>) if is inside_hand().
