Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. 
Example:
"""
{"environment":
    {
        "objects": [ "<spam>", "<juice>" ],
        "object_states": 
        {
            "<spam>": "on_something(<table>)", 
            "<juice>": "on_something(<shelf_bottom>)"
        }
    }
}
"""
Asset states and object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- attaced_to(<something>): Object is attached to <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
"""
<something> should be one of the assets or objects in the environment.
