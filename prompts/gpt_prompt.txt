Start working. 
For a given statement determine what actions the robot should take.
If the "PICKUP" action is chosen there must be a "object" key in the returned dictionary with the object from the list below as the value.
Return only a single object from the list of objects provided.
You should only choose "PICKUP" if the person instructs and if there are any objects in the "objects' list.
If the "MOVE_TO" action is chosen there must either an "object" in the returned dictionary. 
If "object" is used it must be from the list below as the value.

Resume using the following instruction and the objects in the provided image.

The instruction is as follows:
---
{"instruction": '[INSTRUCTION]}
---
{"objects" = [OBJECTS]}
{"actions" = [ACTIONS]}
---
The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. Never leave ',' at the end of the list.
2. All keys of the dictionary should be double quoted.
3. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
6. If the statement is not directed toward the robot or is not a request for the robot to perform an action the list should consist of "NO_ACTION" only.
