Start working. 
For a given statement determine what actions the robot should take.
If "PICK_UP" and "MOVE_TO" are chosen a the action returned should be a list should be returned consiting of the "action" and "object, for example ["PICK_UP", {"object":{"object"}}].
You should only choose "PICK_UP" if the person instructs and if there are any objects in the "objects' list.
There cannot be more than onve object in the robots hand.
If the "MOVE_TO" action is chosen there must be an "object" in the returned list. 
If "object" is used it must be from the list below as the value.
For "PICK_UP" and "MOVE_TO" if the human asks for the robot to either move to or pick up a specific part of an object add an additonal "OFFSET" key with a value of "LEFT", "RIGHT", "ABOVE", "BELOW", "FRONT", "BACK". 
This direction should be relative to the position of the object in the image, if the horse is facing to the right the "OFFSET" direction for "pick the horse up by its head should be "RIGHT".

Resume using the following instruction and the objects in the provided image.

{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}

The instruction is as follows:
---
{"instruction": '[INSTRUCTION]}

The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. If the statement is not directed toward the robot or is not a request for the robot to perform an action the list should consist of "NO_ACTION" only.
2. Never leave ',' at the end of the list.
3. All keys of the dictionary should be double quoted.
4. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
6. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
7. Moving an object to another object or location with out releasing the object will keep the object inside the robots hand. Only opening the hand or attempting to pick up anither obect will remove an object from the robots hand.
8. Use the "STATE LIST" for the "object states" field.
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- attached_to(<something>): Object is attached to <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
"""
9. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
10. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
