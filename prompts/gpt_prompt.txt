Start working. 
For a given statement determine what actions the robot should take.
If "PICK_UP" and "MOVE_TO" are chosen as the action returned should be a list should be returned consisting of the "action" and "object, for example [{"action":"PICK_UP", "object":"object"}].
You should only choose "PICK_UP" if the person instructs and if there are any objects in the "objects' list.
There cannot be more than one object in the robot’s hand.
If the "MOVE_TO" action is chosen there must be an "object" in the returned action dictionary. 
If "object" is used it must be from the list of objects in "environment_before" below as the value.
For "PICK_UP" and "MOVE_TO" if the human asks for the robot to either move to or pick up a specific part of an object add an additional "location" key.
The value of the "location" key should be a string decribing the location.
Resume using the following instruction and the objects in the provided image.

{
    "objects":["tan tray", "orange tray", "tan horse body", "blue horse legs", ""orange horse legs", "table", "robot gripper"]
}

{
    "environment_before":[ENVIRONMENT],
}

The instruction is as follows:
---
{"instruction": "[INSTRUCTION]"}

The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. If the statement is not directed toward the robot or is not a request for the robot to perform an action the list should consist of "NO_ACTION" only.
2. Never leave ',' at the end of the list.
3. All keys of the dictionary should be double quoted.
4. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
6. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
7. Moving an object to another object or location without releasing the object will keep the object inside the robot’s hand. Only opening the hand or attempting to pick up another object will remove an object from the robot’s hand.
8. Use the "STATE LIST" for the "object states" field.
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- attached_to(<something>): Object is attached to <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
"""
9. All keys of the dictionary should be double quoted.
10. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
