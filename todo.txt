Run Short WoZ pilot
	Track what people say/how they instruct the robot
	Force people and robot to use 1 hand

Once parts are picked get language on how to build
	
Timeline
	Run WoZ  = VR + some real world
	Eval of WoZ by 1st week of June
	User study started by 1st  week Aug
	All done but final writing by Sept 1st

Robot questions
    what parts do you want to use, and waht parts should the robot pick up
        hand over object is this the correct
            while not move to next most and repeat

    ask if picked part up correctly
        if not reposition

    look at part in hand get slots
        verify how many
        move arm below each slot ask if correct location
        ask if correct 
            adjust and reverify
        if guess about slot amount wrong
            if under ask where it is reative to known location


What parts do you want to use? 
What parts should the robot pick up?
How do you want to do this?
